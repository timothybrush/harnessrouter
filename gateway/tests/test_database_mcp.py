"""A database as an ORDINARY MCP server on a harness — the entry, the agent's tool, the app's
data plane, and the one rule that matters more than any of them: the connection string never
comes back out.

Every request in this file goes through the real app with local backing (SQLite + encrypted files
in a temp dir), so what is asserted is what a caller would actually receive.

THE CREDENTIAL CHECK IS NOT ONE TEST. `_seen` records every response body and every line the
gateway printed, and the last test asserts the password appears in none of them — so a route added
later that leaks it fails this file even if nobody writes a test for that route.

Tests that need a real database are skipped when one is not reachable; the gate, the entry and
the refusal paths run everywhere. Two are seeded on the test VM:
    ssh -f -N -L 55432:localhost:55432 -L 33306:localhost:33306 azureuser@20.98.237.6
