"""Making media as an ORDINARY MCP server on a harness — the chain that picks a model and says
which one it picked, the jobs that outlive the turn, the canvas, the export, and the one rule that
matters more than any of them: the provider key never comes back out.

Every request in this file goes through the real app with local backing (SQLite + encrypted files
in a temp dir), so what is asserted is what a caller would actually receive. Every PROVIDER call
goes through an httpx MockTransport, so the five adapters are genuinely exercised — the URL, the
body, the parsing — and nothing is spent doing it.

THE CREDENTIAL CHECK IS NOT ONE TEST. `_seen` records every response body and every line the
gateway printed, and the last tests assert the provider key appears in none of them — so a route
added later that leaks it fails this file even if nobody writes a test for that route.

Tests that need a REAL generation are skipped unless HR_TEST_TOKENROUTER_KEY is set, and when it is
they use the shortest duration and the smallest size the model allows, one call each, reusing task
ids rather than resubmitting. No generation is ever looped.
