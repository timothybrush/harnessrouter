"""Running one SELECT against a customer database, safely.

Two callers, one engine, one place the credential is resolved:

  * the `database` MCP server this gateway hosts, so an agent can explore a schema and test a
    query while it designs a dashboard;
  * `POST /v1/harnesses/{id}/servers/{sid}/query`, which a dashboard app calls to refresh its
    panels when someone opens it.

The second is why the MCP server is not the whole story. Opening a dashboard must re-run its
queries without spending an agent turn — a turn per panel per page-load is both slow and billed.
Both paths land here, so the read-only gate and the row cap cannot be true of one and not the
other.

WHAT NEVER LEAVES THIS PROCESS. The connection string is resolved from the secret store inside
the gateway. The runner never receives it (an agent gets a per-turn capability, never a DSN), and
neither does the browser. That is the same shape MCP bearer tokens already use: config stores
`vault:<ref>`, the live value is fetched at the moment of use.

THE READ-ONLY GATE IS NOT THE ONLY DEFENCE, and the documentation says so. It is a parser, and a
parser is a thing that can be wrong. Point the kit at a database account that only has SELECT and
the two defences are independent.
