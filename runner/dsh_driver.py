"""One DeepSeek Harness turn, as a runner subprocess.

Spawned per turn by server.py (the same one-process-per-turn contract as every other backend:
the runner reads NDJSON off stdout, cancel is a process-group kill). Inside, the official
Python SDK (`deepseek-harness-sdk`, pinned) drives the bundled JSON-RPC runtime executable
(`deepseek-harness-runtime-bin`, same pinned version); every `session.event` notification is
re-emitted on stdout as one JSON line for server.py's normalizer.

THE RELAY, and why it exists. The dsh LLM adapter accumulates streamed tool calls the OpenAI
way — id from `call.id`, name from `call.function.name`, guarded by `!== undefined`. OpenAI
OMITS those fields on continuation deltas; aggregators like TokenRouter send them as EMPTY
STRINGS, so the second delta overwrites the real id/name with "" and every tool call dies as
UNKNOWN_TOOL (captured live 2026-08-20 against deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash). The relay sits on
loopback between the runtime and the endpoint and drops those empty fields from tool_call
deltas — nothing else is touched. It also means the REAL key lives only in this process: the
runtime is launched with DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL pointing at the relay and a placeholder key, so the
credential never enters the dsh process env, its session log, or anything it could checkpoint.

    """Our overlay on the runtime's stock `sdk` profile, in the loader's own patch grammar: a row
    named by id is merged, `disabled: true` stops one, and `insert` appends new rows.

    The stock JSON-RPC server row is disabled and ours inserted in its place (see
    hr_dsh_server.mjs: resume-or-create), one dsh-mcp-client row is inserted per enabled MCP
    server, and a non-deepseek family gets its route merged into the stock dsh-llm-pi-ai row.
    A patch cannot rename a row, which is why the server is disable-plus-insert rather than the
    name swap the previous runtime's bundled cordis.yml allowed.

    The sdk profile's sandboxing executor rows are disabled and the local executors inserted, the
    composition rc7 shipped (dsh-bash-local, dsh-fs-local). This is the state upstream itself
    names, "sandbox_permissions is not available in this composition (no sandboxing executor to
    escalate)": with a sandboxing executor mounted, every file tool advertises the escalation
    fields `sandbox_permissions` and `justification`, meant for a one-shot retry after a denial.
    GPT models fill them on every write regardless, and under danger-full-access each such call is
    refused as "not strictly wider than this call's current mode": twenty refused writes in one
    turn, the file never created, on gpt-5.2 through gpt-6-astra (the dsh matrix column through
    Vercel, 2026-09-08); DeepSeek and Claude leave the fields alone. A field that does not exist
    cannot be filled. The workspace and the container are the boundary here, as for every other
    backend. `permission` goes with them: it throws over an unconfined executor."""
