"""One Aider turn, as a runner subprocess.

Spawned per turn by server.py (the same one-process-per-turn contract as every other backend: the
runner reads NDJSON off stdout, cancel is a process-group kill). Inside, aider is DRIVEN IN PROCESS
through `aider.main.main(..., return_coder=True)`, which hands back the constructed Coder without
running the interactive loop — rather than launched as a CLI whose printed text we would parse. That
entry point is aider's own: its GUI calls it (`gui.py:71`) and its test suite covers it. It is NOT a
supported API, and saying so would be a lie upstream has already contradicted — aider's scripting
page states that "the python scripting API is not officially supported or documented, and could
change in future releases without providing backwards compatibility". This is why the version is
pinned EXACTLY and why install-time checks assert the symbols this driver reaches for.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, measured on the pinned 0.86.2. Aider has no machine-readable output mode,
and its stdout is ONE channel carrying both the model's prose and aider's own diagnostics. A stub
was made to return model prose whose second line began `litellm.AuthenticationError:`; on stdout it
was BYTE-IDENTICAL to a real 401 on the same stream, same exit code 0, no colour under --no-pretty.
So no anchored regex can separate "the provider failed" from "the agent wrote about an error", and a
text-parsing normaliser for this backend would invent failures on ordinary answers. In process the
two are never mixed: a real failure reaches io.tool_error/io.tool_warning and leaves
`coder.usage_report` None, while prose reaches io.assistant_output only.

WHAT ELSE ONLY WORKS IN PROCESS:
  * The shell intercept (see _Gate). Upstream's --yes-always deliberately auto-DECLINES every shell
    command the model proposes, and in driver mode aider forces yes_always on itself
    (main.py:546-547), so wrapping io.confirm_ask is the only way to let a skill's script run — and
    the only place a per-harness tool policy can be applied to a command before it executes.
  * Relocating the repo-map tags cache out of the workspace root (see main), which has no CLI flag
    and would otherwise hand the user a `.aider.tags.cache.v4/` directory as a deliverable.

The event protocol is dsh_driver's: one {"m": method, "p": payload} JSON object per line on stdout,
normalised by _aider_to_claude in server.py.

    """Give aider back the model record that the `openai/` prefix hides from it.

    server.py prefixes every id with `openai/` on purpose, so aider resolves it through litellm's
    openai provider verbatim instead of through aider's MODEL_ALIASES table, which rewrites 21 ids.
    The cost went unmeasured until the google column: litellm's lookup for a prefixed name only
    falls back to the bare id when that id's own `litellm_provider` IS openai (models.py:228-231).
    So `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` keeps its full 66-key record while EVERY gemini, claude, grok and qwen
    id resolves to an empty dict.

    Empty info is not cosmetic. aider reads its limits off that record, so a turn runs with
    max_input_tokens and max_output_tokens of 0 and REPORTS them: measured on
    google|aider|gemini-3-flash-preview (2026-09-16), a truncated answer died with
    `Input tokens: ~45,356 of 0 -- possibly exhausted context window!`, an accusation about a
    1,048,576-token model built entirely out of the absent record. base_coder.py:1492 reads
    `supports_assistant_prefill` off the same dict to decide whether a `finish_reason: length` may
    be continued by prefilling the assistant turn, and an empty dict always answers no.

    The fix asks the info manager for the BARE id: the same lookup aider would have done without the
    prefix, and no alias rewriting, because this queries the manager rather than constructing a
    Model. Whatever litellm ships is what aider gets -- no limit is hardcoded here -- and an id
    litellm does not know (claude-opus-4.8, grok-4.6, qwen3.8-max and kimi-k3 among them) writes
    nothing and leaves the turn exactly as it behaves today.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is change whether a turn passes, and the temptation to claim otherwise was
    measured away. litellm records no `supports_assistant_prefill` for the gemini family either, so
    the abandon-on-length path is identical with and without this file, and an A/B of that one pair
    -- three runs each way, 2026-09-16 -- put every recycle in the same band whichever driver ran:
    19.9s / 209.0s with it, 210.8s / 222.8s / 229.2s without, and the original 399.1s failure is the
    tail of that same distribution rather than a defect this repaired. This makes the limits real
    and the failure legible. Nothing more.
