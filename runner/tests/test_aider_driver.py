"""The aider backend (Aider-AI/aider, Apache-2.0, pinned to 0.86.2).

aider is the only backend here driven IN PROCESS, and every test below pins one of the reasons why.
The reason that decided it: on stdout, model prose beginning `litellm.AuthenticationError:` is
BYTE-IDENTICAL to a real 401 — same stream, same exit code 0 — so a text-parsing normaliser would
turn ordinary answers into provider failures. In process the channels are separate at the source.
