"""The openhands backend (OpenHands V1 through openhands-agent-server 1.49.2, MIT).

Every test below pins something measured against a real agent-server on the pinned version, not a
reading of its docs. The four that decided the design:

  the agent is FROZEN at the conversation's first creation — a second create carrying `tools: []`
      left the persisted agent holding ['terminal', 'file_editor'] and the turn wrote its file
  the credential is NEVER persisted — base_state.json holds the whole LLM spec with `api_key: None`,
      so a resumed turn had no key and litellm's backoff hid that for two minutes
  the turn's answer can arrive as a FinishAction rather than a trailing assistant message
  disabling a tool is enforced by OMISSION — with Shell and Edit both withheld the same request
      that wrote a file under the full tool list produced no file and no tool call at all
