"""One OpenHands turn, as a runner subprocess.

Spawned per turn by server.py, the same one-process-per-turn contract every other backend keeps:
the runner reads NDJSON off stdout and cancel is a process-group kill. Inside, this starts an
`openhands-agent-server` on loopback, drives ONE turn over its HTTP + WebSocket API, and exits.

WHY A SERVER AT ALL. The base runs OpenHands V1 through `openhands-agent-server`, the REST/WebSocket
interface its vendor maintains (OpenHands/agent-sdk). The CLI that used to be the obvious choice —
PyPI `openhands`, from OpenHands/openhands-cli — opens its README with "This project is no longer
actively maintained" and last released 1.16.0 on 2026-05-08. The agent server released 1.49.2 on
2026-09-17.

WHY ONE SERVER PER TURN rather than one resident server. Measured on the pinned 1.49.2: cold start
to a serving `/alive` is 3.3-4.1 s, and a conversation created by one server process is read back
intact by a DIFFERENT process on a different port over the same on-disk store (verified by killing
the first and querying the second). That is what makes the per-turn shape work at all, and it is
the shape this product needs: sandboxes are recycled between turns, so a resident server would hold
conversation state for workspaces that no longer exist. The cost is that 3.7 s on every turn.

The event protocol is dsh_driver's: one {"m": method, "p": payload} JSON object per line on stdout,
normalised by _openhands_to_claude in server.py.

    on the create call (a request field, not a server-assigned one), so a uuid5 is all it takes — a
    uuid rather than a name because the field is typed `uuid.UUID`.

    THE TOOL POLICY IS PART OF THE IDENTITY, and that is not decoration. The agent is frozen at the
    conversation's FIRST creation: measured on 1.49.2, a second create for the same id carrying
    `tools: []` left the persisted agent holding `['terminal', 'file_editor']` and the turn wrote
    its file anyway, and there is no endpoint that updates an agent (`PATCH /conversations/{id}` is
    metadata — "like title"). Keying the id on the policy means a changed policy is a new
    conversation, created with the tools it asks for. The cost is that changing the policy starts a
    new thread; the alternative is running with a tool the operator has since disabled, which is the
    overstatement UHP 4.3 forbids and the direction this must never fail in.
