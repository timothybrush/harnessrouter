# Community Edition setup and operations

Detailed installation, configuration, API, and deployment instructions. For the shorter five-step path, start with the [README quickstart](../README.md#quickstart). This guide retains separate image-pull and container-start steps, so its installation sequence has six steps.

## Install

Six steps, and at the end of them you have a running instance, a signed-in console, and an agent
that has answered you.

You need Docker, about 4 GB of disk, and an API key from a model provider. There is no account to
create and nothing to sign up for. You also set a local Console password after the first sign-in.
Model requests use the provider and credentials you configure.

### 1. Pull the image

```bash
docker pull harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

About 700 MB to download.

<details>
<summary>Pinning a version instead of <code>latest</code></summary>

`latest` tracks the current release. Pulling downloads an image but does not update an existing
container; follow [the upgrade steps](#restarts-upgrades-and-backups). Use a version tag for a
specific release, or an image digest when you need the exact same image. Releases are listed on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harnessrouter/harnessrouter/tags).

</details>

### 2. Run it

Copy this as it is. Nothing in it is a placeholder — no provider key, no password.

```bash
docker run -d --name harnessrouter \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -v harnessrouter:/data \
  harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

If port 3000 is already busy, change only the left-hand number (`-p 127.0.0.1:3100:3000`), because
the container always listens on 3000 inside.

<details>
<summary>What each part of that line does</summary>

`-p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000` keeps the console reachable only from this machine. That is what makes it
safe to start on a default login and change it afterwards.

`-v harnessrouter:/data` is where everything durable lives: the database, your files, and the agent
CLIs installed on the first start. Keeping that volume is what makes every later start fast.

No provider key, because you connect a provider from the console in step 5. That is the shorter
road: a key pasted into a form cannot be misspelled into a shell history, and changing it later does
not mean recreating the container.

No password, because the instance starts on a default login that step 4 gives you and asks you to
change.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do not add <code>--user</code>: the container starts as root and drops privileges itself</summary>

The container must start as root, and from 0.8.2 it refuses to start any other way, with one line
saying so. This is not the usual "runs as root" shortcut; it is the opposite. Root is needed for
exactly one thing: every agent CLI runs as its own per-session user, which owns that session's
workspace and nothing else. The entrypoint and Runner retain root to manage those users. The
Console and Gateway run as an unprivileged user; each agent process runs under its session user.

What that buys you, inside one container serving many sessions:

- An agent cannot read or write another session's files, the databases, the blob store or the
  secret store. Not "is told not to": cannot, because those paths belong to other users.
- A file an agent saves to the wrong place fails at the write, while the model is still there to
  correct itself, instead of silently disappearing outside the collected workspace.
- An agent process carries none of the product's secrets in its environment.

No extra privilege is granted to get there: no `--privileged`, no `--cap-add`, no custom seccomp
profile. Docker's default capability set already includes what a root process needs to switch to
another user, and that is all that is used.

If you run with `--user` today (or `user:` in a compose file), remove it before upgrading. The
documented command above never set one, and a volume from any earlier version is adopted in place
on the first start.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Choosing your own username and password at <code>docker run</code></summary>

Two optional variables. Set them and they replace the defaults; the console never shows you the
default login again.

```bash
docker run -d --name harnessrouter \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -v harnessrouter:/data \
  -e HR_AUTH_USER=you \
  -e HR_AUTH_PASSWORD=the-password-you-chose \
  harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

Whatever you put after `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD=` **is** the password — sign in with exactly that in step
4. You do not need this to get started, and changing the password from the profile page later works
just as well; it exists for a box built by a script, where nobody is going to open a browser.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using Docker Compose instead</summary>

Run these commands from a checkout of the repository root, where `docker-compose.yml` and
`.env.example` live. Before starting, change the published port in
[`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml) from `3000:3000` to `127.0.0.1:3000:3000`.
Then copy `.env.example` to `.env` and run `docker compose up -d`.

</details>

### 3. Wait for it to say it is ready

**Do not open the browser yet.** `docker run` gives your prompt back in about a second, but the
console needs roughly another half a minute, and until then <http://localhost:3000> refuses the
connection. That is the first start still working, not a broken container.

```bash
docker logs -f harnessrouter
```

Wait for `ready on :3000`, then open the browser:

```
[harnessrouter] installing Claude Code (Anthropic's terms apply)…
[harnessrouter] installing opencode (MIT)…
[harnessrouter] installing Qwen Code (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing Gemini CLI (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing Cline (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing Codex (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing Pi (MIT) and its MCP adapter (MIT)…
[harnessrouter] installing Oh My Pi (MIT)…
[harnessrouter] installing goose (Apache-2.0)…
[harnessrouter] installing DeepSeek Harness (MIT, developer preview — version-pinned)…
[harnessrouter] installing Hermes (check its upstream license before use)…
[harnessrouter] data=/data  backends available: claude codex hermes pi dsh opencode qwen gemini cline omp goose kimi grok
[harnessrouter] ready on :3000
```

Installed CLIs are cached on the volume, so later starts are usually faster. New or previously
failed backends can still trigger installation work. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop following logs;
this does not stop the container. If the Console is not reachable immediately after the ready
line, retry after a few seconds while its server finishes starting.

<details>
<summary>The other lines, and why the first start is the slow one</summary>

`backends available:` lists what actually installed, so a backend that failed is named rather than
silently missing, and the others still work.

You will also see this line, and it comes back on every start until you change the password in step
4. On a loopback-only instance it is a reminder rather than a problem:

```
[harnessrouter] WARNING: using the DEFAULT password. Set HR_AUTH_PASSWORD, or change it from the profile page, before exposing this instance.
```

The enabled agent CLIs are fetched from upstream on first start rather than bundled in the image.
Each remains subject to its upstream license and terms; this repository's Apache 2.0 license does
not replace them. Review [NOTICE](../NOTICE) and each tool's terms before use. The running
instance's catalog reflects the backends that are actually available.

</details>

### 4. Sign in

Open <http://localhost:3000>, or the host port you chose in step 2, and sign in with:

| | |
|---|---|
| Username | `harnessrouter` |
| Password | `harnessrouter` |

![The sign-in screen](images/01-login.png)

**Change the password now**, from **Profile** in the account menu. Saving briefly restarts
the Console.

If you set `HR_AUTH_USER` or `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD` at `docker run`, sign in with those instead — the
defaults are then refused.

These credentials sign you into the Console. You do not need a HarnessRouter API key to run tasks
there. Create one later when [integrating your product backend](#using-the-api).

<details>
<summary>Where the password lives, and what to do if you forget it</summary>

Printing the defaults here is what makes them a placeholder rather than a secret, which is why the
container warns about the password on every start until you change it.

The profile page asks for the current password as well as the new one, so an unattended tab cannot
be used to take over the instance. New credentials are stored on the data volume
(`/data/selfhost-auth.json`: a username, a salt and a hash, never the password) and take precedence
over the environment from then on — an `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD` set at `docker run` months ago cannot
quietly undo a password change. After one, the start-up line changes to say where the real password
came from:

```
[harnessrouter] sign in as 'harnessrouter' (credentials set from the profile page)
```

Saving also signs out every other browser. Yours stays signed in.

Forgot it? There is no reset email to send, so delete `/data/selfhost-auth.json` and restart. The
instance falls back to `HR_AUTH_USER` / `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD`.

</details>

### 5. Connect a model provider

**Nothing runs until you do this.** There is no bundled model, no trial key, and no free tier
hiding in the image.

Open **Bring Your Own Key** in the sidebar (the Integrations page) and press **Add Integration**. It asks three things: a name, the provider,
and that provider's API key. This key authorizes model requests; it is not a HarnessRouter API key.

![Adding a provider on the Integrations page](images/05-add-integration.png)

Which models that provider serves is not your problem to configure: the product keeps that list and
adds to it as providers ship models. Pick the provider, paste the key, and the models it covers
appear on the row.

A model that shipped after this release is one row away: open the integration, add the model with
the id the provider uses on the wire, and save. It appears in every model picker the provider
drives, and a task may name it. A task that names a model no connected provider serves on that
base is refused before it starts (`400 model_not_available`), never run on another model;
`GET /v1/harnesses/{id}/models` lists what a harness can run.

<details>
<summary>Running more than one provider</summary>

The mappings underneath the integrations decide which one serves a given model. With a single
integration there is nothing to set.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Your own endpoint: a proxy or a gateway that names its models its own way</summary>

Pick the **Custom** provider. It asks for the API format the endpoint speaks (OpenAI Chat
Completions, OpenAI Responses for Codex, or Anthropic Messages), the endpoint URL, the key, and
the **models** it serves. Each model row pairs the id a harness picks (the same ids every other
provider uses, `gpt-5.5`, `claude-opus-4.8`) with the name this endpoint wants on the wire. That
name is an arbitrary string per row and is sent verbatim: a bare vendor id, a deployment alias, a
versioned SKU. Leave it blank to send the model id as it is. No transform is applied, because the
name a proxy expects is a fact about that proxy and nothing else.

The mapping is a property of the connection, not of a harness: a harness picks a model by its id,
the connection decides how that id is written for its endpoint. Two harnesses that need different
vocabularies on one endpoint are two connections to it.

**Disabled built-in tools.** Some endpoints refuse an agent's built-in tools per model (a proxy
that answers `400 The following tool is not allowed for model 'gpt-5.5': web_search` to Codex).
Name those tools on the connection, comma-separated, and every turn through it runs without them;
for Codex's `web_search` that is a hard switch in its configuration, not a request. The same field
exists on each harness, for tools you want off regardless of the endpoint.

Custom OpenAI Responses connections start with Codex's function tools only. The Codex namespace
(`multi_agent_v1`) and built-in `web_search` are disabled by default because compatible endpoints
often reject those tool types. Set `namespace_tools` or `web_search` to `"1"` in the connection
configuration (or turn the corresponding console switch on) when the endpoint supports them;
`disabled_tools` still takes precedence for `web_search`.

Codex offers no `apply_patch` tool on a custom endpoint (measured on 0.154.0: no model gets it, known
or not; it exists only inside Codex's own multi-environment executors), so a Codex turn on a custom
Responses connection tells the model that file edits go through the shell tool and that a call to a
tool named `apply_patch` is refused. A model that otherwise loops on "unsupported call: apply_patch"
(issue #202) stops at that instruction.

</details>

<details>
<summary>The same, from a script (the integrations document)</summary>

The console saves one document, and you can write it yourself. `PUT /v1/admin/integrations` with the
console's session (or a key of this instance) takes the whole document; `GET` reads it back with
keys redacted. Rows are matched by `name`, so a `PUT` with an existing name replaces that row.

```json
{
  "integrations": [
    {"name": "proxy-anthropic", "provider": "custom",
     "config": {"api_format": "anthropic", "base_url": "https://proxy.internal/anthropic", "api_key": "…"},
     "models": [{"canonical": "claude-opus-4.8", "provider_id": "anthropic--claude-4.8-opus"}]},
    {"name": "proxy-openai", "provider": "custom",
     "config": {"api_format": "responses", "base_url": "https://proxy.internal/openai/v1", "api_key": "…",
                "disabled_tools": "web_search"},
     "models": [{"canonical": "gpt-5.5", "provider_id": "gpt-5.5"},
                {"canonical": "gpt-5.4", "provider_id": "prod-gpt-v2"}]}
  ],
  "model_map": {"claude-opus-4.8": "proxy-anthropic", "gpt-5.5": "proxy-openai", "gpt-5.4": "proxy-openai"}
}
```

`models` on a custom row is the endpoint's whole list. On every other provider the list comes from
the product's own table for that vendor, and a `models` row there only changes the wire id of a
model that table already lists. `model_map` routes a model id to the integration that serves it;
a model with no route goes to the first integration that can serve it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Setting it from the environment instead, for a scripted deploy</summary>

A connection names a provider and its credential; a policy says which connection a backend uses.
Useful when the box is built by a script and nobody is going to open a browser:

```bash
-e HR_SECRET_GLOBAL_HARNESS_CONN_ANTHROPIC='{"name":"anthropic","provider":"anthropic","api_key":"sk-ant-…"}'
-e HR_SECRET_GLOBAL_HARNESS_POLICY_CLAUDE='{"chain":["anthropic"]}'
```

There is one policy variable per backend: `…POLICY_CLAUDE`, `…POLICY_CODEX`, `…POLICY_HERMES`. An
OpenAI-compatible endpoint of your own takes the same pair with a `base_url` added, and
`"provider":"openai"` rather than the `"openai-api"` that `.env.example` still shows:

```bash
-e HR_SECRET_GLOBAL_HARNESS_CONN_LOCAL='{"name":"local","provider":"openai","api_key":"…","base_url":"https://api.example.com/v1"}'
-e HR_SECRET_GLOBAL_HARNESS_POLICY_CODEX='{"chain":["local"]}'
```

Not every provider fits every backend. A pairing that does not fit is refused before the runner
is called, and the response's error names the connection and why (`a custom endpoint in the
openai format cannot drive codex, which speaks the responses format`); a provider the runner
itself refuses is answered at once with the runner's own sentence. The Integrations page only
offers you providers that work.

</details>

<details>
<summary>An Azure connection without an API key (Microsoft Entra)</summary>

For an organization that issues no API keys for its Azure resources. The connection is an application
in your own Entra directory, and tasks sign in as that application.

Register it once and give it a role on the resource it may call:

```bash
APP=$(az ad app create --display-name "HarnessRouter models" --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg --query appId -o tsv)
az ad sp create --id "$APP" >/dev/null
RESOURCE=$(az cognitiveservices account show -g <resource group> -n <resource name> --query id -o tsv)
az role assignment create --assignee "$APP" --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" --scope "$RESOURCE"
az ad app credential reset --id "$APP" --append --display-name harnessrouter --years 1 --query password -o tsv
```

The last line prints the client secret once. On the **Integrations** page add an **Azure OpenAI**
connection, set **Sign in with** to **Microsoft Entra**, and enter the endpoint URL, the directory
(tenant) ID, the application (client) ID and the client secret. A role assignment can take a few
minutes to take effect.

What happens on a task: the gateway asks Microsoft Entra for a token as the application, keeps it
until shortly before it expires, and presents it on each model call in place of an API key. The agent
holds neither the secret nor the token. That is true even though this image hands an API key
connection straight to the agent (`HR_SANDBOX_TRUST=owner`): a token lives for about an hour and a
task can run for longer, so a connection of this kind always goes through the gateway, which asks
again as the token ages.

When the sign-in is refused, the task fails with Entra's own reason, for example
`Your azure connection was refused: ... Microsoft Entra refused this connection's sign-in: AADSTS90002: Tenant '...' not found`.
When the application has no role on the resource, the reason is Azure's:
`The principal ... lacks the required data action Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/responses/write`.
A directory or application ID that is not a GUID, or a missing secret, is refused when you save.

The same role serves a Foundry resource (kind `AIServices`); its endpoint is
`https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com`. A connection reaches the models deployed on the resource
under the names this instance knows them by.

A sovereign cloud sets `HR_ENTRA_AUTHORITY` (default `https://login.microsoftonline.com`).

</details>

<details>
<summary>What a backend with nothing connected says</summary>

Forthcoming about it, which is what you get if you skip this step entirely:

```json
{"error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","code":"invalid_input","message":"no provider configured for backend 'codex'. Add an integration for a provider that serves 'gpt-5.4-mini', or configure a connection policy"}}
```

</details>

### 6. Give it something to do

**Agent harnesses → pick a harness → New task.** Every harness lists its own tasks; a fresh
draft opens with the caret in the box. Choose a model on the chip under the message, and type.
The turn streams back as it happens: every command the agent runs, every file it touches, and
the answer at the end.

![A task: the request, the commands, the files it wrote, and the test result](images/task-run.png)

That is the whole install. State is SQLite and files on one Docker volume. Deleting that volume
deletes the instance's durable data. See [backups](#restarts-upgrades-and-backups) before moving it.

<details>
<summary>What is happening in that screenshot</summary>

That one asked for a small utility with tests. The agent wrote it, built a fixture tree with
duplicates planted in it, ran the suite, and came back with `OK (3 tests passed)`, which is an answer
you can check rather than one you have to trust. Everything it produced is on the transcript to
take away, a file at a time or the lot as a zip.

</details>

---

## Restarts, upgrades, and backups

For a stopped container, use `docker start harnessrouter`; to restart it, use
`docker restart harnessrouter`. Running the original `docker run` command again while a container
with that name exists gives a name conflict.

To upgrade, back up your data, pull the desired image, stop and remove only the old container, and
recreate it with the same volume, ports, and configuration. Keep `HR_SECRET_KEY` unchanged if used.
Do not delete the data volume. For Compose, use `docker compose pull` followed by
`docker compose up -d`; avoid `docker compose down -v`, which removes volumes.

Stop the container before copying the volume so the SQLite databases and files form a consistent
backup. Preserve the volume's permissions and keep any configured encryption key securely
alongside your deployment records. Restore the volume and the same configuration before starting
the replacement instance.

## Starter kits

Starter kits are worked examples, and they are here to show you what this can be pointed at.

Each one is a whole agent product rather than a snippet: an app, an agent configured to drive it,
and the skill that teaches that agent the format it writes. Use one, then read it: every kit is
available in the [Starter Kits repository](https://github.com/HarnessRouter/starter-kit), under its
[separate licensing terms](https://github.com/HarnessRouter/starter-kit#licensing). More arrive over
time; your instance lists the ones it has.

![The Starter Kits page, before any kit has been launched](images/dashboard-1-starter-kits.png)

Launching asks one question: what to run it on.

<details>
<summary>What the launch dialog is telling you</summary>

Each card names the base and the model it will run on before you launch it, so you can see what a
kit is about to spend before it spends it. What it names depends on the keys you gave it in step 5:
the screenshot above is an instance with three providers connected, and an instance with one will
recommend that one on every card.

The runtimes you have no key for are listed but disabled, with the reason on them:

> Hermes · `deepseek-v4-pro` · Not connected. Add a provider that serves this model to use it.

What the dialog recommends is a suggestion you can overrule, not a default you have to accept.

</details>

### Slides

A deck is one conversation. Ask for a presentation and the agent designs it: structure first, then
a style system, then slide by slide. Slides appear while it works, so when the shape is wrong you
can say so while there are two slides to change instead of twenty.

The deck below came from one sentence: *"A 5-slide deck explaining what a container image is, for
new engineers."*

![The Slides editor: the sentence at the top of the conversation, the run underneath it, and the deck it produced](images/kit-slides.png)

<details>
<summary>What you are looking at in the panel on the right</summary>

That is the run, not a progress bar. It settled the structure, built a style system, checked what
the canvas would accept, wrote the deck, then validated it, and it says so as it goes.

Nothing here is a picture of a slide: every element is a real object on the canvas, so you can drag
it, resize it, retype it, or ask for another pass in the same conversation.

</details>

### Sheets

Rows are your data. An agent column runs one of your harnesses on every row, with the columns to
its left as input, and the sheet fills itself cell by cell. Press Run and it fills in row order with
a live count and a Stop button, because a column of a thousand rows is a thing you should be able to
change your mind about.

This one opened with *"help me build a sheet, i wanna use this to map investors in silicon valley.
the goal is to provide this one to investors outside of SV the startups invested by investors based
SV."*

![The Sheets editor: the request at the top of the conversation, real investor rows, and an agent column's output on each one](images/kit-sheets.png)

<details>
<summary>How that sheet got built</summary>

From that sentence, the agent decided the columns, worked out which of them a person fills in and
which one an agent should, and wrote the per-row prompt itself. The rows came from a follow-up,
*"search some real data and from internet"*, and it went and found four real investors with their
firm's own profile pages rather than inventing plausible ones.

</details>

<details>
<summary>If the agent-column menu says you have no other agents</summary>

An agent column runs one of your *other* agents, and a sheet will not run itself. So on an instance
where Sheets is the only thing you have launched, the column menu has nothing to offer and says so:

> Choose an agent… · You have no other agents yet. Create one, then choose it here.

**Harnesses → Add Harness** is the fix: a base, a model, a name, and it is ready in seconds. The
picker then lists it with the model it runs on. If you add one while a sheet is open, reload the
sheet first, because the list is read when the page loads.

</details>

### Dashboards

Say what you want to understand and point it at a database. The agent reads your schema, writes a
query per question, picks the chart that answers it, and lays the panels out. Opening the dashboard
re-runs every query, so what you see is the database now, not a snapshot from whenever it was
built.

![Launching the Dashboards kit: what to run it on, and which database to read](images/dashboard-2-launch.png)

This is the one kit with setup, and it is two fields: the connection and the sample-rows switch.

![The Dashboards kit: both turns of the conversation on the right, and the live panels they produced](images/kit-dashboard.png)

<details>
<summary>How that dashboard got built, and why its numbers are worth trusting</summary>

It opened with *"Revenue by month and the top 5 countries by revenue, plus total paid revenue."*
Both turns of that conversation are in the panel on the right: the first built it, and the second,
*"Enrich the dashboard like this"* with a picture of the layout attached, is where the panels you
see came from.

There is nowhere in a dashboard to type a number. Every figure on that page is the result of a
query that ran when the page opened, which is the property that makes it worth trusting. Ask for a
change and it runs each query before it wires it into a panel, so a panel that renders is a panel
whose query works.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Connecting a database</summary>

Three things to know before you connect one.

**The container has to be able to reach it.** If your database is another container, put both on
the same user-defined network so the database's *name* resolves. Docker's default bridge has no
DNS, so on it only the container's IP works, and that IP changes:

```bash
docker network create hr-net
docker network connect hr-net my-postgres
docker run -d --name harnessrouter --network hr-net \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 -v harnessrouter:/data … harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

Then `my-postgres:5432` works as a host in the connection string. A database on the host machine
rather than in a container is reachable at `host.docker.internal` on Docker Desktop, or via
`--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` on Linux.

**Set `HR_SECRET_KEY`.** Connection strings are encrypted at rest under a key derived from it,
and without it the server refuses to store one rather than writing your production credential to
disk in plaintext:

```bash
-e HR_SECRET_KEY=a-long-random-passphrase
```

Keep it. Change it and the stored connections can no longer be decrypted, and you reconnect them.

**Use a read-only database account.** Every statement is checked and only `SELECT` is allowed,
non-`SELECT`, multiple statements and data-modifying CTEs are refused, and on PostgreSQL the
query additionally runs in a `READ ONLY` transaction. That check is a parser, and a parser is a
thing that can be wrong. An account that has been granted `SELECT` and nothing else is a second
defence that does not depend on ours being right:

```sql
CREATE USER dashboards WITH PASSWORD '…';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE shop TO dashboards;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO dashboards;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dashboards;
```

The connection string is resolved at the moment a query runs. The agent's sandbox never receives
it. It gets a tool that runs `SELECT`s, and neither does the browser.

**Sample rows** are a per-connection switch, on by default: the agent sees a few real rows per
table so it can tell a status column from a category one. Turn it off and it sees table and
column names and types and no values at all.

### Videos

Describe a film and get one back: it plans the shots, renders each, lays them out on a canvas you
can rearrange, and assembles them into a single video you can download. Clips render in the
background, so you keep working while they arrive.

![The Videos kit: the brief at the top of the conversation, every shot on the canvas, and the finished film above the timeline that assembled it](images/kit-video.png)

The conversation on the right is the whole job: what was asked for, what the agent found it could
actually generate and at what price, the storyboard it settled on, and what it wants you to check
before the film goes out. It costs what it says it costs, per clip, and it tells you before it
spends.

> [!WARNING]
> This is the one kit that spends real money per second of output rather than per turn, because
> every shot is a generation. Try it once you already know what the console is doing.

## Plugins

A plugin is a service your workspace connects once; each harness then includes the ones it needs,
and its agent gets that service's tools on every task. The catalog is on the **Plugins** page of the
Console, and every row of it is one plugin: what it is, its state here (Connected, Needs auth,
Disabled, Not connected), what it costs, and how many harnesses include it.

| Plugin | What the agent gets | What you provide |
|---|---|---|
| Browser | A real web browser: open a page, read it, click, type, scroll, wait, take a screenshot, go back, switch tabs. Thirteen tools, no JavaScript evaluation, no downloads. | Nothing on the page. The instance needs either a [Browser Use Cloud](https://browser-use.com) key or a browser of your own in its environment (below). |
| GitHub | The connected repository: files, branches, commits, pull requests. | An access token and the repository (`owner/name`). |
| Vercel | The connected project: deployments and domains. | An access token, the project id and team id. |
| InsForge | The connected backend: its tables and records. | The API key and the backend's address. |
| Microsoft 365 | SharePoint sites, OneDrive files, Outlook mail and calendar and the directory's people, read as each signed-in person or as your own application. Nine read tools. | Your organization's Microsoft Entra application (directory id, application id, client secret); then each person signs in with Microsoft once. |

**Your own browser.** `HR_BROWSER_CDP_URL` on the container (`-e HR_BROWSER_CDP_URL=http://host.docker.internal:9222`
for a Chrome started on the host with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, or any Chrome DevTools
Protocol address) makes that browser the one every task uses, in place of the vendor: no vendor
session and nothing metered, one browser context per task so tasks do not share cookies or tabs,
and no live view in the console. The vendor's browser refuses private and local addresses, since
a page it loads must not reach into the network it runs on; your own browser sits on your own
network and reaches what your shell already can, so that rule is lifted for it. The site lists
below still apply.

**Turning a plugin on.** Open **Plugins**, and on the row choose **Turn on** (the browser) or
**Connect** (a plugin that needs a credential; the credential is kept in the instance's secret store
and never shown again). **Settings** changes what the plugin may do: the browser's site lists ("only
these sites", "never these sites", matched by domain suffix; empty means any public site), a GitHub
plugin's repository. **Turn off** keeps the record and refuses the agent's calls with a sentence
until it is turned on again. Nothing is included on a harness by turning a plugin on.

**Including it on a harness.** Open the harness, find **Plugins** under its settings, and mark the
plugin **Included**. Over the API, the harness's plugins are its `plugs` attachment:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$HARNESSROUTER_BASE_URL/v1/plugs/browser" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HARNESSROUTER_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled":true,"config":{"allow_domains":["example.com"],"deny_domains":[]}}'
curl -s -X POST "$HARNESSROUTER_BASE_URL/v1/harnesses/$HID/servers/plugs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HARNESSROUTER_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"plugs":["browser"]}'
```

### Microsoft 365

The plug runs through an application you register in your own Microsoft Entra directory, so the
organization decides what it may do, and Microsoft's own permissions are the boundary: a private
SharePoint site stays private, a mailbox is its owner's. Two identities, chosen when you connect:

- **Each person signs in with Microsoft** (the default). Every call an agent makes on a person's
  behalf runs as that person and reads exactly what they may read. Each person signs in once per
  workspace, from the **Plugins** page; an agent working for someone who has not signed in is told
  to ask them, and never borrows another identity.
- **The application itself**, for unattended work, with the application permissions an administrator
  consented to; it must name the site or person it means.

Register the application once (the delegated permissions are what a person consents to at sign-in;
add application permissions only for the application identity):

```bash
GRAPH=00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000
APP=$(az ad app create --display-name "HarnessRouter Microsoft 365" --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg \
      --web-redirect-uris "https://<your console>/plugins" --query appId -o tsv)
az ad sp create --id "$APP" >/dev/null
for perm in openid profile offline_access User.Read User.ReadBasic.All Sites.Read.All Files.Read.All Mail.Read Calendars.Read; do
  id=$(az ad sp show --id $GRAPH --query "oauth2PermissionScopes[?value=='$perm'].id" -o tsv)
  az ad app permission add --id "$APP" --api $GRAPH --api-permissions "$id=Scope"
done
az ad app permission admin-consent --id "$APP"
az ad app credential reset --id "$APP" --append --display-name harnessrouter --years 1 --query password -o tsv
```

The last line prints the client secret once. On the **Plugins** page choose **Connect** on the
Microsoft 365 row and enter the directory (tenant) id, the application (client) id, the client secret
and the identity. The ids and the secret are checked at Entra as you save. With the delegated
identity the row then reads **Needs auth** until you choose **Sign in with Microsoft**: Microsoft's
own sign-in page opens, you come back to the Plugins page, and the plug keeps your sign-in for this
workspace (its refresh token, in the instance's secret store under your own field) and shows who
you are. **Sign out** forgets it. Over the API the same steps are
`POST /v1/plugs/microsoft365/microsoft/start` (`{"redirect_uri": ...}` gives the address to open),
`POST /v1/plugs/microsoft/complete` (`{"code", "state"}` from the return) and
`POST /v1/plugs/microsoft365/microsoft/signout`.

What the agent gets: `resources` (whose identity it runs as, how to address a site or a person),
`find_people`, `list_sites`, `list_files`, `search_files`, `read_file` (a SharePoint site as
`hostname:/sites/name`, a person's OneDrive, or its own), `list_mail`, `read_mail`, `list_events`.
Every call is one audit row on the session, naming the site, person, path or folder it addressed.
What Microsoft refuses is what that identity may not see, and the agent is told to report it rather
than work around it. The directory behind an Azure subscription alone has no Microsoft 365 licence:
sign-in, `resources` and `find_people` work there, while files, mail and calendar answer Microsoft's
own refusal until the tenant holds a licensed seat.

`GET /v1/plugs` lists the catalog with each plugin's state for your workspace;
`GET /v1/plugs/browser/attachments` says how many harnesses include it. A package can ask for a
plugin with `"requires": {"plugs": ["browser"]}` in its `plugin.json`; the harness it lands on
includes the plugin, and the workspace still has to have connected it.

**Watching and taking over.** When a task opens a browser, the console brings up a Browser card
beside the conversation and streams the vendor's live view of it; the edges of the screen tint
blue while the agent has the browser and breathe while it acts, and a ghost cursor glides along a
small arc to wherever the agent last clicked or typed. The browser's screen is landscape whatever
the card's shape: the card shows the whole screen at the largest size that fits, with its own
surface around it; beside the conversation it floats, centred, at the height the screen needs,
with the conversation squeezed to its left (on a phone it sits under the conversation instead;
drag the divider or go full screen for a larger view). The card's top row carries every action: **Take over**
(or a click on the screen) makes the view yours to click and type in and pauses the agent, whose
next browser call waits for you without spending tokens and runs the moment you choose **Hand back
to the agent** (after 45 seconds of waiting the call answers that you still have the browser and
the agent may keep waiting or go on without it); **Full screen** fills the window and **Close**
puts the card away. The card
closes itself when the browser closes; the **Browser** button in the task header, there whenever
the harness includes the browser plugin, opens it at any time, with or without a browser in it.
A harness that includes the plugin also tells its agent so, in a Browser section of the agent's
instructions file: use the browser tools for the web and never curl or a web search instead
(Codex keeps its MCP tools behind a tool search and reached for curl without it).
Behind it: `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/browser` (open or not, who has it, the live view address, which
is a credential and is served only to the session's owner) and
`POST /v1/sessions/{sid}/browser/control` with `{"control": "user"}` or `{"control": "agent"}`;
the harness event feed carries `browser.opened`, `browser.call` (with the point the agent acted on
and the page's viewport), `browser.held`, `browser.control` and `browser.closed` (never the address).

**The browser.** The browser runs in Browser Use Cloud and is driven from this instance; the agent
never holds the browser's address or the key. Set the key in the container's environment:

```bash
docker run -e BROWSER_USE_API_KEY=... ...
```

Until it is set, the browser's tools answer that the browser service is not set up on this
deployment. Every session is one browser per task, opened on the agent's first browser tool call
and stopped when the task ends, after two idle minutes, or after twenty minutes, whichever comes
first; each call has sixty seconds; at most three browsers per workspace are open at once
(`HR_BROWSER_ORG_SESSIONS`) and nine per instance (`HR_BROWSER_MAX_SESSIONS`). Private, loopback
and link-local addresses are never reachable, on a page or in anything a page loads. Screenshots
are kept with the task's files. What the vendor charges ($0.02 per browser hour at the time of
writing, rounded up to the minute) is what a session costs you on your Browser Use account; this
instance keeps no ledger, and the price shown on the Plugins page is the vendor's list price with
no markup, read from the same table the hosted service bills from. Every call and every session is
written down on the task's trace (event type `plug`, plug `browser`, with the minutes and the
vendor's figure on the session row).

## Environments

A task's workspace starts empty and is checkpointed after every turn with its dependency
directories left out, so a project that is uploaded into it is uploaded again next time and its
packages are installed again. An **environment** is that project as one thing: its files and its
installed dependencies, built once, and read by every task that names it.

Every task that uses one finds it at `/env/<slug>` (the name, as a path segment), read-only and
shared, with the environment's Python virtualenv and `node_modules` first on `PATH`, the project on
`PYTHONPATH`, and `PROJECT_ROOT` naming the path. The task's own workspace stays what it was:
writable, private to the session, checkpointed, and the only place its outputs come from. Two tasks
on one environment share every byte of it and cannot read each other's workspace or write the
environment; behind the write-wall an agent runs as its session's user and the environment is
root's, so a write fails rather than being merely discouraged; it is readable by the sessions of the harnesses that name it and by no other session, which cannot list the environments the box holds either. The agent's instruction file says all
of this, and repeats the "how it is run" line you gave.

On the console, **Environments** (under Build): create one, then put the project in, one file at a
time, as an archive, or from a git repository (the tree is kept; a single wrapping folder is
stripped), and press **Build**. The build copies the files into a new version and installs what they
declare (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` into `.venv`, `package.json` with npm, then
`setup.sh` for anything else), logs the installers' output, and makes the version the one tasks
read when it succeeds. Editing files afterwards changes nothing a task sees until the next build;
an older version can be made active again with one click. Then name the environment under a
harness's settings (**Project environment**), or on one task with `environment` in the request. A
task on an environment with nothing built is refused before it starts.

Where it lives: `/data/environments/<id>/` on the data volume (`source/`, `versions/<n>/`,
`active`), with the `/env/<slug>` links remade after a restart. A build runs in the runner with the
image's own `python3` and `npm` and the network, for at most `HR_ENV_BUILD_TIMEOUT` seconds
(1800); an import may be `HR_ENV_IMPORT_MAX_BYTES` (512 MiB) and a file `HR_ENV_FILE_MAX_BYTES`
(64 MiB). System packages are the image's (`ffmpeg`, LibreOffice, Playwright are there); a
`setup.sh` runs with the build's privileges, so it is yours to trust. The API is under
`/v1/environments`, in the [API reference](#using-the-api) and in the
[Environments chapter](../protocol/versions/2026-09-28/environments.md) of the protocol.

## What it is

An *agent harness* is the runtime layer around a model; Codex, Claude Code, and Hermes are harnesses. In this repo's API you also create *harness* objects: a saved configuration whose `base` is one of those runtimes, plus a model, instructions, and limits. A *task* is one run of that configuration, a real conversation against a real POSIX workspace with bash and git, streamed back as it happens.

HarnessRouter Community Edition implements UHP for both: an OpenAI **Responses-compatible** API for
running turns, harness CRUD, sessions, streaming, cancellation, and idempotency. The console is
a thin client over that API; anything the UI does, you can do from `curl`.

**The console is the hosted product's console.** Not a cut-down rebuild: the same pages, the
same components, the same API client. Surfaces that need a service a single box doesn't have,
such as accounts, billing, and marketplace, are simply not shown.

**Supported harnesses:** the running instance's catalog lists what is available, including Codex,
Claude Code, Hermes, DeepSeek Harness, and other enabled backends. They are installed on first
run rather than shipped in the image. Review each tool's upstream terms before use.

**Bring your own key.** Configure providers in Integrations or through environment-based connection
policies. Credentials are not baked into the image; model requests follow your chosen provider
and credentials.

**What the hosted service does that this edition does not.** The protocol, the console and the
starter kits are the same; these are the parts that need a service a single box does not have:

- **Billing.** Credits, grants, usage in dollars per task and the per-task spend counters belong to
  the hosted ledger. Here you pay your providers directly; `max_cost_usd` on a task or a harness
  still caps a turn, read from the provider prices.
- **Plugins as accounts.** On the hosted service a plugin is the organization's own account kept by
  a registry and managed only on the Plugins page; here the registry is local to this box, and the
  browser plugin connects without a credential.
- **People and workspaces.** The hosted service signs in many members, each with their own
  sessions, across several workspaces per organization; this box has one login, and every session
  is that person's.
- **Live events across replicas.** The hosted gateway runs several replicas and fans a session's
  live events out across them; this box is one process.
- **Microsoft 365.** On the hosted service the plugin signs people in through the organization's
  own Entra application; here it uses the application you register for this box.

## Why self-host

- **Your keys, your bills, your data.** You control the deployment and provider credentials.
  Harnesses and tools may also make network requests needed for the tasks you run.
- **Real workspaces.** Agents get bash, git, and a filesystem, their native environment, not a
  sandbox emulation.
- **No Console product telemetry.** Product analytics are disabled in the Community Edition Console.
- **The same UHP contract as the hosted product.** Your application can use the shared protocol
  in either edition; deployment, authentication, and provider configuration differ.
- **Actually self-contained.** No control plane to phone home to, no managed database.

## The Unified Harness Protocol

This repository is both an implementation and a standard. The protocol the gateway speaks is
specified, versioned and testable in [`protocol/`](../protocol/), and documented at
[unifiedharnessprotocol.org](https://unifiedharnessprotocol.org):

| | |
|---|---|
| [Specification](../protocol/versions/2026-08-11/) | Ten normative chapters, version `2026-08-11` |
| [Machine-readable](../protocol/schema/) | OpenAPI 3.1 + JSON Schema 2020-12, generated from one source |
| [Conformance suite](../protocol/conformance/) | passing it is what "conformant" means, and what earns the right to the UHP name |
| [Governance](../protocol/GOVERNANCE.md) | How the standard changes, and the naming and conformance policy |

This edition is the reference implementation. The [recorded conformance run](../protocol/conformance/#reference-implementation-results)
on September 4, 2026 passed all 64 checks at class Full, with no failures, skips, or errors
(suite `2026.8.11.post1`, protocol `2026-08-11`). This is a dated measurement, not a test rerun
for every subsequent release.
**The standard can be implemented without HarnessRouter Cloud**: it is an HTTP contract, and
nothing in it requires a hosted service. Run the suite against your own server:

```bash
# From the repository root
pip install -e protocol/conformance
uhp-conformance --base-url https://your-server --api-key "$KEY" --class full
```

## Configuration

<details>
<summary>Choosing backends, and building with a browser</summary>

Backends are installed into your data volume rather than baked into the image, so which ones you
want is a run-time setting:

```bash
docker run -e HR_BACKENDS=claude,codex,hermes,pi,dsh,opencode,kilo,qwen,gemini,cline,omp,goose,kimi,minimax,grok,aider,openhands,agentzero,systemone,cheetahclaws ...  # the default
docker run -e HR_BACKENDS=opencode ...                             # lean
```

Aider, OpenHands and Agent Zero are the largest of the set: each environment is 600-700 MB and takes
a minute or two to install on a fresh volume. All three are in the default list anyway, because the
console offers every base the catalogue lists and a base that did not install fails on its first
task; leave any of them out of `HR_BACKENDS` if you will not use it.

Agent Zero (`agentzero`) is a framework rather than a CLI, so it is installed from its tagged source
archive (digest-pinned) into a virtualenv rather than from a package registry: 569 MB of virtualenv
and 69 MB of source, 83 seconds on a fresh volume (measured on Linux arm64). It takes upstream's own
dependency pins, minus the packages that serve only what this base switches off (local embeddings and
speech, which would bring torch; document parsing; the browser; its messaging integrations).

A backend that fails to install is not fatal: the others still work. The console offers every
base the gateway's catalogue lists, so a task on a backend that did not install fails on its
first turn; the container's log names the install that failed.

Chromium is genuinely an image layer, so it stays a build flag:

```bash
docker build -t harnessrouter --build-arg WITH_BROWSER=1 .
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>What the entrypoint sets for you</summary>

| Variable | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `HR_BACKING` | `local` | SQLite + files on `/data`. No external storage. |
| `HR_IDENTITY_MODE` | `off` | One box, one owner; an accounts system would be ceremony with nothing behind it. |
| `HR_CREDIT_GATE` | `off` | Metering is a hosted concern. |
| `POOL_MGMT_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:8081` | The runner is in this container. |
| `HR_POOL_AUTH` | `none` | No cloud identity to present to a loopback runner. |
| `HR_SANDBOX_TRUST` | `owner` | You own the box, the agent and the key, so the key is handed over directly rather than brokered. |
| `HARNESS_WORKSPACE` | `/data/workspaces` | One directory per session, on the volume, so a restart doesn't discard work in flight. |
| `HR_WORKSPACE_TTL_HOURS` | `72` | Idle session workspaces are removed after this. They rehydrate from their checkpoint, so this costs time, not work. `0` keeps them forever. |
| `HR_RELAY_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_S` | `600` | How long one model call may go without sending anything before the task is told the provider did not answer. Several model APIs send nothing while a model thinks (OpenAI's Chat Completions sends nothing at all), so a shorter wait cuts long thinking off. Lower it only if you would rather end a stuck call sooner than wait out a long think. It was `180` in 0.31.0 only. |
| `HR_ENTRA_AUTHORITY` | `https://login.microsoftonline.com` | Where an Azure connection that signs in with Microsoft Entra asks for its token. A sovereign cloud names its own. |
| `HARNESS_RESP_HOLD_S` | `3` | How long the gateway lets the runner hold a request for a turn's events. `0` asks every 1.2 s as before 0.30.1. |
| `HARNESS_INTERNAL_KEY` | generated | Per-container; never leaves the process tree. |

Outside this image the gateway's own default for `HR_IDENTITY_MODE` is `enforce`: a request that carries the internal key beside a sign-in token is answered as the organization and member the token proves, and refused when the token does not verify. Set `off` only where, as here, the console in front of the gateway pins the one organization itself.

</details>

## Using the API

A harness is a pluggable agent backend that runs agent tasks for your product. Integrate a built-in
or custom harness through your self-hosted HarnessRouter instance's OpenAI Responses-compatible
API. `metadata.harness_id` selects the harness that runs each task, so you can switch harnesses
without redesigning your product backend. No Cloud account or upload is required.

Three credentials have three separate jobs:

| Credential | Held by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Console password | A person using the browser | Manage this CE instance and run tasks in its Console |
| Provider API key | HarnessRouter | Call the model provider configured under **Integrations** |
| HarnessRouter API key | Your product backend | Authenticate API calls to this CE instance and its workspace |

For the default local installation, the API base is `http://localhost:3000/api/harness`. Use the
host and port of the CE instance you actually started. If your backend runs on another machine
or in another container, `localhost` refers to that caller, not automatically to HarnessRouter.
The default Docker command publishes port 3000 only on the host's loopback interface. Keep that
default for same-machine development. For remote callers, deliberately make the instance reachable
through a trusted network or reverse proxy and use HTTPS; see [Putting it on a public URL](#putting-it-on-a-public-url).

Before wiring in a product, connect a provider and run one task in the Console with the harness and
model you intend to call. That verifies the execution path before adding network and backend-auth
variables. It is a setup check, not a technical prerequisite for the API.

### Create a key on this CE instance for your backend

1. Sign in to the Console of the CE instance your product will call, then open **API Keys** in the sidebar ([default local address](http://localhost:3000/keys)).
2. Confirm the workspace containing the harness, then select **Create API key**. Give it a name and select **Create key**.
3. Copy the secret shown once. Store it in your product backend's secret store or environment. The examples call this variable `HARNESSROUTER_API_KEY`.

The key is scoped to the selected workspace and can be rotated or revoked on the same page.
A key made in a workspace other than the Default Workspace reaches that workspace and nothing else:
a harness, a task, a file or a response of another workspace is answered `404`, the same as an id
that does not exist, and such a key makes new keys for its own workspace only. A key made in the
Default Workspace, and an organization key (the **Reach** choice when you create a key), reach every
workspace of the organization. A built-in base (`codex`, `claude-code`, ...) runs with any key.
It is created in this self-hosted instance and authenticates requests to that CE deployment. It is
neither a Cloud key, your Console password, nor the model-provider key configured
in **Integrations**. Never put it in browser-side code or commit it to Git.

### Install a package on a harness

A package is a folder in the [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org) format: `plugin.json` at its
root, tools in `mcp.json`, Skills under `skills/`. Installing one gives a harness all of it at once,
and the harness records it as a named, versioned package it can export again. Starter kits built from
the kit release that carries packages ship their Skills this way, so a kit launched from such
an image shows the kit as an installed package; a kit launched earlier keeps its Skills as its own.
(A package is not a plugin in the sense of the [Plugins](#plugins) page: a plugin is a service the
workspace connects once; a package is files a harness carries.)

In the Console, open the harness, find **Packages**, and choose **Install from folder**. Over the API,
`plugins` is a field of the harness record. The simplest case is a new harness created with the
package in it:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$HARNESSROUTER_BASE_URL/v1/harnesses" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HARNESSROUTER_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Contract Review Agent","base":"claude-code",
       "plugins":[{"files":[
         {"path":"plugin.json","content":"{\"$schema\":\"https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json\",\"name\":\"contract-review\"}"},
         {"path":"skills/risk-checklist/SKILL.md","content":"---\nname: risk-checklist\ndescription: Turn an agreement into a risk checklist.\n---\n..."}
       ]}]}'
```

To add a plugin to a harness that already exists, remember that `PUT /v1/harnesses/{id}` replaces
the whole mutable configuration: any field you leave out is cleared, and an omitted `mcp_servers`
also removes the hosted tools behind it. Read the harness first, then send back its current
`system_prompt`, `default_model`, `mcp_servers`, `skills`, `disabled_tools`, `additional_headers`,
`max_step`, `timeout_seconds` and `reasoning_effort` (the write body uses these snake_case names; the record you read
uses camelCase) with the new package appended to `plugins`. Installed plugins round-trip as
`{name, enabled, blob}`, so send those back unchanged and add the new one beside them.

The record you read back carries what the server derived from the package (`manifest`,
`mcpServers`, `skills`, and `skipped` for anything it could not load) and a `blob` handle that
round-trips on the next PUT. Everything set aside across the harness's packages is also listed
once under `notLoaded`, with the path and the reason, so a client sees it where the console shows
"not loaded": a Skill whose `description` runs past the Agent Skills cap of 1,024 characters is
the usual one, and a run on such a harness goes ahead without that Skill. A `plugin.json` must
name its schema, `"$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json"`.
A Skill that expects environment variables gets them from the harness's `env` field (a name to a
literal, a `vault:<ref>`, or `$headers.X-Name` for a declared request header); every task's shell
and tools start with them. The harness's own `mcpServers` and `skills` stay exactly what you wrote
there; a plugin's components are listed on the plugin. Names must not collide across the harness and
its enabled plugins. A package that declares a process (a `stdio` server) installs on every base: the
runner writes one launcher per server and each agent's own MCP client runs it (pi's adapter and dsh's
client included). A remote server reaches each client in its own spelling, and a client without an SSE
transport of its own (codex, dsh, goose) still takes an SSE server: the runner hands it a stdio bridge
that speaks SSE to the remote end, so every transport installs on every base. `GET /v1/harnesses/{id}/plugin` exports the harness's own tools and Skills as a
package, credentials omitted. The full contract is the
[Plugins chapter](https://unifiedharnessprotocol.org/spec/2026-09-12/plugins) of the protocol.

### Run a task

This example assumes `HARNESSROUTER_API_KEY` is already set. Choose an installed harness and a
model served by your connected provider. For a custom harness, use its **Harness ID** as
`metadata.harness_id`.

Set the base URL to the CE instance as seen by your backend. Creating a task requires **POST**. The
command below supplies a request body, so curl uses POST; opening the endpoint in a browser's
address bar sends GET and does not run a task.

```bash
export HARNESSROUTER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/harness

curl --fail-with-body -sS "$HARNESSROUTER_BASE_URL/v1/responses" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HARNESSROUTER_API_KEY:?}" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":"Reply with exactly this and nothing else: it works.",
       "metadata":{"harness_id":"codex"},
       "model":"gpt-5.4-mini",
       "stream":false}'
```

```json
{"id":"resp_284e450bc2be4de8bea94c4af6030292","object":"response","created_at":1786822334,
 "status":"completed","error":null,"incomplete_details":null,"previous_response_id":null,
 "model":"gpt-5.4-mini",
 "output":[{"id":"msg_3d71e018c6584abbb063ee16d9a36e75","type":"message","status":"completed",
            "role":"assistant",
            "content":[{"type":"output_text","text":"it works.","annotations":[]}]}],
 "store":true,
 "usage":{"input_tokens":10878,"output_tokens":34,"total_tokens":10912},
 "metadata":{"session_id":"hsessa79756fab07a4bf58fa072be24d5ce59"}}
```

The task and its transcript appear in the key's workspace in the same Console. API calls
authenticate with the key alone: your backend does not need to log in with a password or maintain
a Console session cookie. Your application's own user authentication and authorization remain
your responsibility.

**Long tasks.** A request with `"stream": false` holds its connection until the task ends, for up
to the task's `timeout_seconds` (an hour by default); the console's own proxy allows the same.
A task you would rather not hold a connection for takes `"background": true`: the response comes
back at once with the task's id and `status: in_progress`, and `GET /v1/responses/{id}` reports
it until it ends. Attached files land in the task's working directory under the name you give;
a relative path in `filename` (`inputs/report.pdf`) puts the file in that folder.

**How much the model thinks.** A task can say it, with the Responses API's own field:

```bash
curl -sS "$HR/api/harness/v1/responses" -H "authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input": "...", "metadata": {"harness_id": "hrn_..."}, "reasoning": {"effort": "low"}}'
```

The levels are `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high` and `xhigh`. A harness can keep a default
for its tasks (`reasoning_effort` on the harness, the Thinking control on its settings page) and a
task's own level wins. Models do not all have the same levels: `GET /v1/bases` lists, per base and
model, the ones each has (`models[].reasoning`), and a model asked for a level it lacks gets the
nearest one it has. A model that cannot be turned off gets its lowest level for `none`; a task
that asked for some thinking is never given none. The response says what happened:

```json
"reasoning": {"effort": "minimal", "applied": "low"},
"usage": {"output_tokens": 262, "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 248}}
```

`applied` is `"default"` when nothing could be set: the model has no measured level on the
connection that served it, or the provider refused the level, in which case the call was made
again without it rather than failed. `reasoning_tokens` is the provider's own count and is absent
where the provider gives none. A task and a harness that set no level send what they sent before
levels existed. Which setting moves which model on which provider was measured, not assumed; the
table and the method are in [support-matrix-notes.md](support-matrix-notes.md), "How much a model
thinks".

<summary>The rest of the surface</summary>

All paths below are relative to the API base above and use the same Bearer key.

| Action | API operation |
|---|---|
| Discover harnesses and models | `GET /v1/harnesses`, `GET /v1/models` |
| Start a task or continue a session | `POST /v1/responses`; set `previous_response_id` to continue a previous turn |
| Check a response | `GET /v1/responses/{response_id}` |
| Stream progress | Set `"stream": true` on the response request for server-sent events |
| Read session history | `GET /v1/sessions/{session_id}/turns` |
| Upload inputs or retrieve outputs | `POST /v1/files`; `GET /v1/sessions/{session_id}/files` |
| Cancel work | `POST /v1/responses/{response_id}/cancel` |
| Describe the API | `GET /v1/openapi.json`, the surface above as an OpenAPI document, readable without a login |
| Inspect execution | `GET /v1/sessions/{session_id}/turns` for the turns; `GET /v1/traces/{session_id}/all` for the stored event stream of the harness as newline-delimited JSON, one event per line (`content-type: application/x-ndjson`; assistant, tool and result events as the CLI emitted them); `/v1/traces/{session_id}/events?chunk=N` reads one stored chunk. Provider-call spans (the model requests behind a turn) are part of the hosted service's observability, not of this edition |

<a id="console-session-auth"></a>

<details>
<summary>Optional: use a Console session for local debugging</summary>

The Console uses a session cookie. You can also use that session from a local terminal when
debugging. This is also supported by self-hosted CE; it is not a Cloud-only flow. The cookie can
authenticate task requests to `POST /v1/responses` as well as the model-list request below.
It is not required for API-key authentication or recommended as your product's backend credential.

```bash
curl --fail-with-body -sS -c hr.cookies http://localhost:3000/api/selfhost/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"harnessrouter","password":"<your-password>"}'

curl --fail-with-body -sS -b hr.cookies http://localhost:3000/api/harness/v1/models
```

Use your current Console credentials, not the initial defaults if you changed them. Treat
`hr.cookies` as a secret, do not commit it, and remove it when finished. Keep authentication enabled;
you do not need `HR_AUTH_DISABLED=1` to integrate your backend.

</details>

## Putting it on a public URL

The console can create harnesses, read every task transcript, and run an agent with your
provider key.

> [!WARNING]
> **Change the password before anyone else can reach the instance.** The defaults are printed
> right here, which makes them a placeholder, not a secret; the container warns on every start
> while the default is still in place. `HR_AUTH_DISABLED=1` removes the gate entirely, which is
> only reasonable on a machine nobody else can reach.

For TLS, keep the console on loopback and put a terminating proxy in front. With Caddy that is
one file and a real certificate, automatically:

```caddyfile
console.example.com {
    encode zstd gzip
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000 {
        flush_interval -1      # agent turns stream for minutes; never buffer them
    }
}
```

The `flush_interval -1` matters: without it a proxy buffers the event stream and the console
looks frozen until the turn ends.

Pin the tag, and do not run `0.1.x` or `0.2.0`: they have no sign-in gate at all, so an instance
running them is open to anyone who can reach the port. `0.3.0` is the first release with one.

<details>
<summary>Why changing the password restarts the console</summary>

Changing it from **Profile** signs out every other browser and restarts the console. That restart
is what makes "signed out everywhere" true rather than merely displayed: the gate reads its
signing key once at start-up and cannot be told about a change in place. A task that is mid-turn
runs straight through it.

</details>

## Moving to the hosted service

Self-host for control, or use **HarnessRouter Cloud** for managed deployment, maintenance, and
scaling. Cloud runs tasks in serverless, isolated sandboxes through the same public API contract
as Community Edition.

When a custom harness is working the way you want, save any pending changes in its **Settings**
and select **Upload to Cloud**.
Connect a destination with an API key created inside the target Cloud workspace. Built-in harnesses
cannot be uploaded directly; create a custom harness first.

The upload copies the harness configuration, including its skills and MCP configuration. It does
not transfer provider keys, sessions, generated files, or the local workspace. Configure the
required model providers in the destination separately.

Update your application's base URL, authentication, and harness ID to use the destination.
The shared API contract does not mean that local credentials or endpoint URLs work unchanged in
Cloud. See the [Cloud authentication](https://harnessrouter.ai/docs/authentication) and
[base URL](https://harnessrouter.ai/docs/base-url) guides.

This is a manual, one-way upload. Later uploads replace the same hosted copy in that destination,
so they can overwrite changes made in Cloud. Cloud edits are not pulled back into the local copy.

Destination API keys are stored encrypted on your local instance for repeat uploads. Set
`HR_SECRET_KEY` before connecting a destination, and preserve the same key across restarts and
upgrades. You can remove a saved destination when it is no longer needed. See
[restarts, upgrades, and backups](#restarts-upgrades-and-backups) before changing container settings.

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The gateway and the runner listen on loopback inside the container and are not publishable; the
console's port is the way in, which is why the login gate ships inside the image rather than in
whatever proxy happens to sit in front.

Sessions have separate workspace directories, conversation state, and checkpoints. Agent
processes run as per-session operating-system users inside the shared container; this is not
a separate sandbox or container per session. Turn concurrency defaults to the machine's core
count. This box cannot scale sandboxes on demand the way the hosted deployment does, so the
limit is what it can actually run.

Storage sits behind a small adapter interface for records, files, and secrets. This repo ships the
local implementations; the hosted deployment supplies its own against the same interface. That
seam is why this is genuinely the same codebase rather than a fork that drifts.
