# Harnesses

**Unified Harness Protocol, version `2026-10-04`**

Before a client can send work it needs to know what can run it, and with which models. This chapter
defines discovery, the harness object, and — at conformance class **Full** — how harnesses are
created and changed.

## 1. Discovering harnesses

```http
GET /v1/harnesses
```

```json
{
  "harnesses": [
    {
      "id": "chrn_08dae611630d467ab3e67ed792570ae5",
      "object": "harness",
      "name": "Research agent",
      "base": "claude-code",
      "baseLabel": "Claude Code",
      "defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-4.6",
      "systemPrompt": "",
      "mcpServers": [],
      "skills": [],
      "plugins": [],
      "disabledTools": [],
      "maxStep": null,
      "timeoutSeconds": null,
      "createdAt": 1786403298205
    }
  ]
}
```

A server MUST return only harnesses within the caller's scope. The list MAY be empty — a server with
no configured harnesses is valid, and a client MUST handle that rather than assuming index `0`
exists.

```http
GET /v1/harnesses/{harness_id}
```

Returns one harness object, or `404` with `code: "harness_not_found"`.

## 2. The harness object

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | `chrn_`-prefixed |
| `object` | string | yes | Always `harness` |
| `name` | string | yes | Human-readable label; not an identifier |
| `base` | string | yes | Which harness runtime: `codex`, `claude-code`, `hermes`, … |
| `baseLabel` | string | no | Display name for `base` |
| `defaultModel` | string | no | Model used when a task omits `model` |
| `systemPrompt` | string | no | Additional standing instructions |
| `mcpServers` | array | no | MCP servers attached to this harness |
| `skills` | array | no | Skills available to this harness |
| `plugins` | array | no | Installed plugins, each a package of tools and skills; see [Plugins](plugins.md) |
| `environment` | string | no | The environment this harness's tasks read, mounted read-only; requires the `environments` capability. See [Environments](environments.md) |
| `disabledTools` | string[] | no | Tools withheld from the agent |
| `maxStep` | integer \| null | no | Default step budget |
| `timeoutSeconds` | integer \| null | no | Default wall-clock budget |
| `createdAt` | integer | yes | Unix milliseconds |

The memories a harness's agent reaches are not a field of this object. The agent is a member and
is granted on the memory, like a person; `/v1/harnesses/{id}/memories` reads what it was granted
and keeps two settings ([Memories §9](memories.md#9-an-agent-and-its-memories)).

`base` values are not enumerated by this specification. A server MAY support bases this document has
never heard of, and a client MUST treat `base` as an opaque string — anything else means the
protocol has to be revised every time a harness is released, which is exactly the coupling UHP
exists to remove.

## 3. Models

```http
GET /v1/models
```

```json
{
  "backends": {
    "claude": {
      "default": "claude-sonnet-4.6",
      "models": [
        { "id": "claude-sonnet-4.6", "label": "claude-sonnet-4.6", "backend": "claude",
          "available": true, "default": true }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```http
GET /v1/harnesses/{harness_id}/models
```

```json
{
  "harness_id": "chrn_…",
  "backend": "claude",
  "default": "claude-sonnet-4.6",
  "fallback": "claude-sonnet-4.6",
  "models": [ { "id": "claude-opus-5", "available": true, "default": false } ]
}
```

### 3.1 `available` is a promise

`available: true` means the server can serve that model for that harness **right now** — a
credential exists and the provider can reach it. `available: false` means a request for it will not
run as asked.

A server MUST compute `available`, not assert it. Listing a model as available and then failing the
task is the worst outcome for a client: it presents a choice to a user, the user picks it, and the
work fails after they have committed to it.

A client SHOULD present unavailable models as disabled rather than hiding them, so a user can see
that a model exists and is not configured, rather than wondering why it is missing.

## 4. Tools and skills

A configured harness carries three things that decide what its agent can do. All three are part of
the harness object and are set the same way it is.

### 4.1 MCP servers

```json
{ "mcpServers": [
    { "name": "vault", "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp", "transport": "http", "enabled": true }
] }
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Identifies the server to the agent; sanitised to a CLI-safe identifier |
| `url` | yes | Endpoint |
| `transport` | no | `http` (Streamable HTTP, default) or `sse` |
| `enabled` | no | Absent or `true` means enabled |
| `headers` | no | Extra request headers |
| `auth` | no | Bearer token, or a server-side reference the server resolves |

This list carries remote servers only, exactly as it did in the previous version. An MCP server that
runs as a process (`stdio`) is declared inside a plugin, which is what gives it a root to run from
and a directory to keep state in ([Plugins §2.2](plugins.md#22-what-the-server-derives)).

A server MUST connect only the **enabled** entries for a turn. A disabled entry MUST NOT be
contacted at all — not connected and then hidden, which would still leak the turn's existence to
whoever operates that endpoint.

An MCP server that cannot be reached MUST NOT fail the task. The turn MUST proceed without those
tools, because a third-party endpoint being down is not a reason to lose the user's work. A server
SHOULD make the degradation visible in the run rather than silent.

> A server MUST NOT advertise MCP support it cannot deliver. If the harness runtime behind it cannot
> speak the configured transport, that is a broken installation, and reporting it only in a log file
> inside the workspace is indistinguishable — to the user — from the model refusing to use the tool.

### 4.2 Skills

A skill is a **folder**, not a file:

```json
{ "skills": [
    { "name": "vault-manual", "enabled": true, "files": [
        { "path": "SKILL.md",            "content": "---\nname: vault-manual\n---\n…" },
        { "path": "references/codes.md", "content": "…" },
        { "path": "scripts/helper.sh",   "content": "#!/bin/sh\n…" },
        { "path": "assets/logo.png",     "content_b64": "iVBORw0KGgo…" }
    ]}
] }
```

- `files[].path` is relative to the skill's own folder and MUST support nested directories. A server
  MUST reject a path that escapes the folder.
- Text is carried in `content`; binary in `content_b64`. A server MUST preserve both byte-for-byte.
- A bundle MUST contain a `SKILL.md`; a server MUST reject one that does not, at configuration time
  rather than at run time.
- A server MUST materialise the **whole folder** where the agent can read it. Materialising only
  `SKILL.md` breaks every skill that carries references, scripts or data — which is most non-trivial
  skills.
- `enabled: false` suppresses a skill, including one inherited from the base.

A server MAY store large bundles out of line, and MUST return the complete file list from:

```http
GET /v1/harnesses/{harness_id}/skills/{skill_id}/files
```

Round-tripping a harness through `GET` and `PUT` MUST NOT lose skill contents. This is the failure
worth designing against: an unrelated edit — renaming the harness — silently emptying a skill folder
that the user cannot tell is gone until an agent behaves oddly weeks later.

### 4.3 Disabled tools

```json
{ "disabledTools": ["WebSearch"] }
```

Names come from the harness base's own tool catalogue. Enforcement differs by runtime and a server
MUST NOT overstate it:

- Where the runtime supports per-tool restriction, the server MUST enforce it as a hard block.
- Where it does not, the server MUST still convey the restriction to the agent — as a standing
  instruction — and MUST NOT silently drop it. Dropping it is the worst outcome: the operator
  believes a tool is off, and it is not.

A client that requires a guaranteed block SHOULD confirm the harness base supports one rather than
assuming `disabledTools` is always hard.

### 4.4 Plugins

```json
{ "plugins": [ { "name": "contract-review", "enabled": true, "blob": "plg_…" } ] }
```

A plugin is an [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) package: `plugin.json`,
`mcp.json` and `skills/`, carried as one folder and installed whole. Its servers and skills join the
harness's own for every turn; the harness's own `mcpServers` and `skills` report only what was
written to them and never absorb a plugin's. The object, the composition rule, the export of a
harness as a package, and what a hosted server owes a running plugin are in the
[Plugins chapter](plugins.md). The capability is `plugins`; a server without it is conformant at
every class.

## 5. Managing harnesses

Conformance class **Full** only. A client MUST check the `harness_management` capability first.

### 5.1 Create

```http
POST /v1/harnesses
```

```json
{ "name": "Research agent", "base": "claude-code", "default_model": "claude-sonnet-4.6" }
```

Returns the created harness object. `base` is REQUIRED and MUST be one the server supports;
otherwise `422` with `code: "unsupported_base"`.

### 5.2 Update

```http
PUT /v1/harnesses/{harness_id}
```

Replaces the mutable configuration. A server MUST NOT change `id`, `base`, or `createdAt`. Changing
the base of an existing harness would silently change the behaviour of every session already
attached to it; a client that wants a different base MUST create a different harness.

### 5.3 Delete

```http
DELETE /v1/harnesses/{harness_id}
```

A server MUST NOT delete the sessions or responses that used the harness. History that disappears
when configuration changes cannot be audited.

## 6. Choosing a harness

Non-normative, but the question every client faces:

| If the task is… | Consider |
|---|---|
| Code editing in a repository | A coding-specialised base (`codex`, `claude-code`) |
| Long-horizon multi-tool work | A base with an explicit step budget and strong tool use |
| Cheap, high-volume classification | The smallest model on any base |

The point of UHP is that this choice stays reversible. A product that speaks UHP can change base or
model with a configuration edit, and can A/B two harnesses against the same input without a second
integration.
