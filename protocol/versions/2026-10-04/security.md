# Security considerations

**Unified Harness Protocol, version `2026-10-04`**

A UHP server runs an agent that executes tools, writes files, and holds a provider credential, on
behalf of a caller it has never met. That is a larger blast radius than a model endpoint, and the
requirements here are collected in one place so an implementer can check them off rather than
rediscover them.

Requirements stated in other chapters are repeated here rather than only cross-referenced. A
security rule a reader has to assemble from six chapters is a rule that gets missed.

## 1. Credentials

- A server MUST authenticate every endpoint except `GET /v1/uhp`
  ([Lifecycle §2](lifecycle.md)).
- A server MUST NOT distinguish "no such token" from "token not permitted here" in a way that lets a
  caller enumerate valid tokens.
- A server MUST NOT echo a credential — the caller's or a provider's — in any response body, error
  message, event, log line, or artifact.
- A server SHOULD support revoking a credential, and revocation MUST take effect for new requests
  immediately.

### 1.1 Provider credentials

The credential a server uses to reach a model provider is the most valuable secret in the system,
and the agent's own sandbox is the least trustworthy place in it: an agent can be induced to read
its environment and print it.

- A server SHOULD NOT place a provider credential where the agent's tools can read it.
- A server that must give a harness a credential SHOULD issue a short-lived, single-session one, and
  MUST be able to revoke it independently of the underlying key.
- A server MUST NOT accept a caller-supplied upstream URL for a brokered request without validating
  it against a configured allow-list. An unvalidated upstream turns the server into an SSRF proxy
  with its own credential attached.

## 2. Object scope

- Every object — harness, response, session, container, file — MUST be scoped to the principal that
  created it.
- A request for an object outside the caller's scope MUST return `404`, never `403`. `403` confirms
  the id exists, which is exactly what an enumerating attacker wants
  ([Architecture §5](architecture.md)).
- Scope MUST be enforced on every operation, not only on read. Cancel, delete, continue and download
  are all object access.

> The conformance suite cannot fully verify this with one credential. An implementer SHOULD run the
> equivalent check with two principals: create an object as A, then attempt every operation on it as
> B, and confirm each returns `404`.

## 3. Artifacts are attacker-influenced content

An agent can be persuaded to write a file with chosen content and a chosen name. Everything that
serves artifacts MUST treat them as hostile.

- Artifact downloads MUST be served with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. Without it, an artifact
  named `x.html` becomes stored XSS against the client's own origin
  ([Files §3](files.md)).
- Artifacts SHOULD be served from a different origin than the console or application UI, so that a
  successful injection cannot reach first-party cookies or storage.
- A server MUST NOT allow a `container_id` / `file_id` pair to address anything outside its
  container. Path traversal through artifact ids is the most likely serious vulnerability in a UHP
  implementation; the conformance suite probes for it (X-08), and passing that probe is a floor, not
  proof.
- A server SHOULD cap artifact size and count per session.

## 4. Prompt injection is in scope for the client

A harness that reads a web page, a repository, or an uploaded file may encounter instructions
addressed to it. UHP cannot prevent this, and a specification that pretended otherwise would be
worse than one that says so plainly.

What the protocol does provide, and a client SHOULD use:

- **`disabledTools`** on a configured harness — the smallest tool set that can do the job is the
  smallest injection surface.
- **`max_step` and `timeout_seconds`** — a bounded task cannot be induced into an unbounded one.
- **Separate harnesses for separate trust levels.** A harness that reads untrusted input SHOULD NOT
  be the same configured harness that holds privileged tools or MCP servers.
- **The event stream.** Tool calls are visible as they happen; a client can surface or gate them.

A server MUST NOT claim that any of this makes an agent safe to point at untrusted input.

## 5. Resource exhaustion

- A server MUST bound task duration, and MUST report `incomplete` rather than `completed` when a
  budget stopped the work ([Lifecycle §3](lifecycle.md)).
- A server MUST refuse a second concurrent task in the same session (`session_busy`) — two agents in
  one working directory is not a defined state, and is also a cheap way to multiply cost.
- A server SHOULD rate-limit task creation per principal and SHOULD expose remaining budget through
  `rate_limit_error` responses rather than by failing opaquely.
- A server MUST bound upload size and reject with `file_too_large` rather than truncating. A silently
  truncated input produces a confident, wrong answer.

## 6. Data handling

- Session artifacts and transcripts MUST be unreachable after the session is deleted.
- A server SHOULD document its retention period. "Indefinite" is an answer; silence is not.
- Session sharing, where implemented, MUST be read-only and revocable, and MUST NOT expose
  credentials or another principal's data ([Sessions §5](sessions.md)).

## 7. Transport

- TLS MUST be used except on loopback.
- A server SHOULD send `Strict-Transport-Security`.
- A server serving any HTML MUST send `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or an equivalent
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` policy.

## 8. Error hygiene

- `error.message` MUST be safe to show a user: no credentials, internal hostnames, file paths, or
  stack traces ([Errors §1](errors.md)).
- A server SHOULD log the detail it withholds, with a correlation id it returns in `error.detail`,
  so an operator can diagnose what a caller cannot see.

## 9. Plugins are third-party code

A plugin ([Plugins](plugins.md)) is instructions and executables written by someone other than the
operator installing it. Installing one extends the harness's trust to its author.

- A stdio MCP server declared by a plugin MUST run inside the sandbox that runs the agent, with the
  agent's privileges and no more. It MUST NOT run on the server host, and MUST NOT be launched
  through a shell.
- A server MUST expand only `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${PLUGIN_DATA}`, only in `args`, `env` and `cwd`,
  and MUST NOT perform any other placeholder or environment-variable expansion. A plugin that could
  read the sandbox's environment into its own process arguments would read whatever credentials the
  sandbox holds ([§1](#1-credentials)).
- A `command` or `cwd` that resolves outside the plugin root is an invalid entry, never a permitted
  one ([Plugins §6](plugins.md#6-running-with-plugins)).
- Plugins are installed by whoever manages the harness (class Full), never per request. A
  per-request plugin would be a per-request MCP server, which [Tasks §1.4](tasks.md#14-reserved-fields-tools-and-include)
  already declines for the same reason: narrowing is safe, widening is escalation.
- A skill inside a plugin is prompt content and is subject to [§4](#4-prompt-injection-is-in-scope-for-the-client).
  A client SHOULD show the manifest's `author`, `homepage` and `repository` before installing, and
  SHOULD show `skipped` after, so that what did not load is not mistaken for what did.
- A server MUST omit `auth` and `headers` from an exported package
  ([Plugins §5](plugins.md#5-exporting-a-harness-as-a-plugin)). An export is meant to leave.

## 10. Environments are shared, and built from what the owner sends

An environment ([Environments](environments.md)) is read by every session that names it, and its
build runs the project's own manifests and `setup.sh`. Three rules follow:

- **Read-only is enforced.** An agent told not to write will still try; a server MUST make the
  write fail, by a read-only mount, a user without permission, or an equivalent, and MUST NOT rely
  on the instruction ([Environments §6](environments.md#6-what-a-session-sees)).
- **A build has a task's privileges, not the server's.** It runs with the toolchain and network a
  task gets and no more; it cannot read another environment or any session. On a multi-tenant
  server it is a job of the tenant that owns the environment ([Environments §9](environments.md#9-security)).
- **Paths are confined at every endpoint.** A file path, an archive member and a repository tree
  are all held to the environment's root; links out of it and absolute paths are dropped, never
  followed ([Environments §3](environments.md#3-files)).

## 11. Memories are read by someone else, later

A memory ([Memories](memories.md)) is written in one session and read in another, by another agent,
for another person. Three properties follow, and none can be left to the agent.

- **What a memory returns is untrusted content.** A record may have been written by a model that
  had read a hostile page. A server MUST present recalled content to an agent as data, fenced from
  instructions, with who wrote it ([Memories §13](memories.md#13-security)).
- **Reach is the harness's grants, on every call.** An agent may walk the tree from where it was
  attached; what it can reach is decided by the server from grants, not by what the agent asks
  for, and a memory it may not read is answered exactly as one that does not exist.
- **A provider's credential never reaches a sandbox.** It belongs to whoever connected the provider
  and is used by the server at the moment of a call ([§1](#1-credentials)).

## 12. Reporting a vulnerability

Vulnerabilities in the reference implementation or in this specification follow private disclosure,
not a public issue. See the repository's security policy. A specification bug that makes a secure
implementation impossible is treated as a vulnerability, not as a documentation defect.
