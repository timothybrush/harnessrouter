# HarnessRouter — self-hosted, all-in-one.
#
# One container runs the whole product: the UI, the gateway, and the agent runner. There is
# no cloud dependency, no control plane to reach, and nothing to provision. State is SQLite
# and files on one mounted volume.
#
# Why one container rather than compose-by-default: self-hosting should be `docker run`. The
# three processes are supervised by a tiny entrypoint, and because the gateway talks to the
# runner over loopback it needs no pool, no service discovery and no cloud identity.
#
# AGENT CLIs ARE INSTALLED ON FIRST RUN, NOT BAKED IN. This is a licensing requirement, not a
# size optimisation: Claude Code ships under Anthropic's own terms ("SEE LICENSE IN README.md")
# and hermes-agent declares no license at all, so neither may be redistributed inside a public
# image. Installing them at first start means YOU install them, under their terms, exactly as
# if you had run npm/pip yourself — and it keeps this image redistributable.
#
# They land in the data volume, so the cost is paid once per volume rather than once per start.
# Choose backends at RUN time:
#
#   docker run -e HR_BACKENDS=claude,codex,hermes,pi,dsh,opencode,qwen,gemini,cline,omp ...  # the default
#   docker run -e HR_BACKENDS=opencode                            ...   # lean
#
# WITH_BROWSER is still a build arg because Chromium and its system libraries genuinely belong
# in the image layer.

# ── UI build ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This is the SAME console the hosted product runs. Surfaces with no self-hosted backend
# (billing, marketplace, analytics, sign-in) are hidden by the edition flag rather than removed,
# so the two stay one codebase. See ui/src/lib/edition.ts.

# `agent` is the PRODUCT's user: the gateway and the console run as it and it owns the data
# volume. The container itself starts as root and the entrypoint drops privileges per process,
# because the runner needs root for one thing: every agent CLI runs as its own per-session uid,
# which owns its session directory and nothing else (the write-wall; see docker/entrypoint.sh).
# The CLIs refuse to run as root anyway (they gate their own permission bypass on it), and they
# never do.
#
# The `rm -rf /home/agent/.npm` is not tidying. HOME is already /home/agent while the kit apps are
# built above, and those builds run as root — so npm leaves ~1600 root-owned files in the cache
# the RUNTIME user then cannot write to. First start-up installs the agent CLIs into the data
# volume as `agent`, npm hits EACCES on its own cache, and the install fails. Its output is
# discarded (entrypoint.sh: `|| true`), so the only symptom is one WARN line and then every turn
# on Claude Code or Codex failing. Hermes survives because it installs through pip, into a venv.
#
# That made two of the three backends unusable on any fresh volume — which is EVERY new install of
# this image. It was invisible here because a long-lived volume keeps CLIs installed before the
# fault existed. The cache is build-time garbage with no runtime value, so it is deleted rather
# than chowned: nothing can inherit ownership of something that is not there.
